Participants of the REEEM GA in Faroe Islands

From November 26th to 28th the sixth General Assembly of the REEEM Project was held in Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands. For this meeting, project partners from the participating research institutions came together to discuss the state of the project, present and discuss intermediate results from the different models.

The focus on the discussion was to evaluate the different scenarios regarding the impact on social, environmental, political and economic dimensions such as air quality, people’s health, the gross domestic product (GDP), the countries’ economy in general and resources and primary materials. Moreover the questions were discussed of how the different models could be connected and the data exchanged between the models.
