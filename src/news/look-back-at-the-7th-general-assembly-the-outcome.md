From April 15th - 17th the REEEM partners have met in Copenhagen at DTU for the 7th and last General Assembly of the REEEM project.

During the two days, the participants exchanged results and processed the work in the project ([read here more details about the agenda of the past GA](http://www.reeem.org/index.php/2019/04/16/last-reeem-general-assembly-has-started/)).

Besides finalizing the results and discussing the progress, the consortium decided to create a brochure which showcases the REEEM results and the strengths and assets of the REEEM partners for possible future cooperations and projects. The brochure will of course be available on this website once it is finalized.

Moreover, more [Deliverables](http://www.reeem.org/index.php/deliverables-by-theme/) have been finalized and are or will be submitted soon to the Euopean Commission.

The progress made during this last GA is an important milestone on the way towards a successful ending of the project.
