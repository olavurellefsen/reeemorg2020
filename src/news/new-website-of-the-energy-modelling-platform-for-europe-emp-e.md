The website of the Energy Modelling Platform for Europe (EMP-E) has been renewed. You may visit it at [www.energymodellingplatform.eu](http://www.energymodellingplatform.eu).

It features general information, news and upcoming events, one page dedicated to the outcomes of the EMP-E 2017 meeting (including the results of a survey run with all the participants) and one page dedicated to the upcoming EMP-E 2018 meeting including all relevant information.

The website also displays the essence of the Platform, a page of 'Resources'. This collects information on all the models employed by the researchers, teams and projects participating to the platform, relevant databases and bibliography. As of last week, it also includes the results of a survey on the models posted to the Model Matrix set up at EMP-E 2017, with information on their application, validation, policy-relevant insights and key publications. Such survey is intended to provide the ground for communication between modelling teams and comparison of models.

All modellers are invited to contribute to the page and the Platform, by using the [contact form](http://www.energymodellingplatform.eu/contact-us.html). Suggestions on further models, databases and literature are most welcome.
