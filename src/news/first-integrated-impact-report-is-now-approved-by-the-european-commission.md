![First integrated impact report](./images/REEEM_1st_integrated_impact_report-300x193.png)This Integrated Impact Report was conducted by the REEEM consortium in early 2018, and has now been approved by the European Commission.

It covers aspects of integrated modelling assessment. Sustainable development has been high on the global agenda over the past couple of decades. The EU in particular appears to be at the leading edge of sustainable development with really ambitious targets been set, both mid and long term. One of the key components of sustainable development is the decarbonisation of the energy system. Moving towards an energy system with a significantly low carbon footprint can be a challenging task. Several factors need to be taken into account when different options are explored and the various trade-offs need to be identified. An energy system affects and is affected by a plethora of aspects and, therefore, its transition to a different pattern may have economic, social and environmental impacts.
