The first papers of the Virtual Special Issue '**Energy transition and decarbonisation pathways for the EU**' of **Energy Strategy Reviews (Elsevier)** are now [online](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-strategy-reviews/special-issue/10WDV2647Z6), with introduction by the European Commission's DG Ener, DG JRC and DG R&I.

The Special Issue focuses on the modelling methodologies, case studies and policy-relevant insights discussed at the first meeting of the [Energy Modelling Platform for Europe (EMP-E)](http://www.energymodellingplatform.eu/) organised by the REEEM project.

The collection provides a peer-reviewed digest of models and insights on decarbonisation pathways for the EU energy system, vis-Ã -vis the Energy Union Strategy. Modelling teams and projects from across Europe contributed.
