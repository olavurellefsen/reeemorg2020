The recording of the webinar on [OSeMBE the Open Source energy Model Base for the European Union](http://www.reeem.org/index.php/osemosys/) is now available.

The webinar, which was originally held on October 10th, gives an overview and some insights on OSeMBE, the OSeMOSYS engagement model developed under task 7.3 in REEEM. You are provided with an introduction to the Open Source energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) and the Open Source energy Model Base for the European Union (OSeMBE) itself. The section on OSeMBE is first explaining the structure of the model before providing insights to the results of the model. The presentation closes with information on the usages of the model.

The model itself and its documentation can be found under [osemosys.org/osembe.html](http://www.osemosys.org/osembe.html). Questions regarding the OSeMBE or OSeMOSYS can be raised in the [OSeMOSYS forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osemosys).
