On Friday October 21st 2016, REEEM will meet in Brussels a high-level panel of eminent science, business and policy representatives organised by the European Commission to inform the recently launched European Decarbonisation Pathways Initiative.

The panel, chaired by Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber (PIK Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research), will meet for the first time, in the presence of Research and Innovation Commissioner Carlos Moedas, and discuss about the decarbonisation of the energy sector. REEEM will give a presentation in the afternoon session, alongside with other EU-funded projects. The panel will produce a report by the second half of 2018.
