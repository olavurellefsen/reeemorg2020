The main goal of the COST conference "Modelling Smart Grids" from 21st to 23rd of September in Prague was to connect researchers and energy providers, traders and operators.

The workshop focussed among other subjects on using and developing modern optimization, statistical and computational methods suitable for energy system analysis. The REEEM partner RLI had a keynote where REEEM and especially the activities and tools of the open energy modelling community were presented. The RLI lead also one of the discussion rounds in the afternoon which was used to exchange about challenges of transdisciplinary research projects and to expand the REEEM stakeholder network.
