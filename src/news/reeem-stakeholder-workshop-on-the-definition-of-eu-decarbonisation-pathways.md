On October 6th, the REEEM project will hold a Stakeholder Workshop at InnoEnergy premises, Brussels.

The workshop, first of a series of two, will focus on the definition of decarbonisation pathways for the EU energy system.

After an initial presentation by the European Commission's DG RTD and by REEEM, the participants will work in groups and provide their insights on relevant context, technical and policy assumptions.
