On June 30th, REEEM participated in the H2020 Contractors Workshop on Energy System Modelling organized by the EC in Brussels, at INEA premises.

During the one day meeting, the four modelling projects funded under LCE21, REEEM, MEDEAS, SET-Nav and REFLEX, met the EC and JRC to unify their efforts into a single EU-wide energy modelling platform. As a result of the workshop, each project was assigned the task of leading one of the four key challenges of energy strategies modelling: Scenarios, Data, Methodology, Dissemination & Exploitation.
