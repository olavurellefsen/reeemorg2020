On Tuesday the 19th of June, Dr Pei-Hao Li presented at [IEW](https://iew2018.org/) his research on integrating demand side flexibility from smart appliances and electric vehicles into energy systems modelling. This research co-funded by REEEM highlights the potentially significant impacts such flexibility could have on peak load and system costs and the need for energy system models to better describe such options within their modelling framework.
