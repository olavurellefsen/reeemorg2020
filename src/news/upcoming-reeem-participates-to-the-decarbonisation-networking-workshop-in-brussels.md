Francesco Gardumi from KTH, on behalf of the REEEM project, will participate to the Decarbonisation Networking Workshop co-organised by the European Commission's DG RTD and the Executive Agency for SMEs (EASME) on February 7th, 2018.

The workshop will bring together EU-funded climate mitigation projects with the objective to stimulate peer-to-peer and science-to-policy discussions on how to get the most out of EU-funded projects for the benefit of the society and policy-making.

The four LCE21-2015 projects REEEM, [MEDEAS](http://medeas.eu/), [SET-Nav](http://www.set-nav.eu/) and [REflex](http://reflex-project.eu/), already linked by a long-term collaboration, will take part to the meeting.
