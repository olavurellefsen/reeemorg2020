      <b>REEEM AIMS</b> to gain a clear and comprehensive understanding of the
      system-wide implications of energy strategies in support of transitions to
      a competitive low-carbon EU energy society, given the objectives and
      framework outlined in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. The provisions
      of the energy services in this society will be defined by their
      sustainability, affordability, efficiency, energy security and
      reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supportive technology impact assessments will target the full
      integration from demand to supply and from the individual to the entire
      system. It will further address the trade-offs across society, environment
      and economy along the whole transition pathway.
    </p>
    <p>
      A focus on behavioral aspects and on technology research, development and
      innovation will be included. The strong integration of stakeholder
      involvement in the whole process of energy system development will be
      addressed as a main aspect of the project. In support of this overall aim,
      this project is developed to address four main objectives: <b>(1)</b> to
      develop an integrated assessment framework <b>(2)</b> to define pathways
      towards a low-carbon society and assess their potential implications{" "}
      <b>(3)</b> to bridge the science-policy gap through a clear communication
      using decision support tools and <b>(4)</b> to ensure transparency in the
      process.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>DEVELOPING AN INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:</b>
        <br />
        Develop and apply a suite of integrated tools and methodologies within a
        robust and transparent analytical framework comprising the full range
        from individual actors to the entire system. Provide a test-bed through
        this framework for more detailed assessments of the implications of
        technology transitions on a region or country (e.g., through case
        studies) as well as on innovation in individual technologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>DEFINING AND ASSESSING PATHWAYS AND CASE STUDIES:</b>
        <br />
        Define pathways towards a low-carbon energy society based on the
        SET-Plan and its Integrated Roadmap. Assess the implications of these
        pathways on the environment, economy and society and derive
        recommendations. Consider aspects such as the impact of the time horizon
        of political decisions, uncertainty and sensitivity of key assumptions,
        the robustness of results, and the resilience of the derived energy
        system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CREATING A SCIENCE-POLICY INTERFACE:</b>
        <br />
        Enable policy makers to understand the implications of these pathways
        and derive supportive strategies. Process the knowledge on the
        implications of different technology measures adjusted to the needs of
        decision makers involved in policy making and energy strategy
        formulation. Provide a range of dissemination materials and decision
        support tools to raise awareness and increase the participation in the
        energy policy debate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ESTABLISHING TRANSPARENCY:</b>
        <br />
        Enable others to challenge assumptions by ensuring all model development
        will be open source, by publishing data sets developed within this
        project and by providing thorough and clear documentation of the work
        developed within REEEM. Develop educational material such as e-learning
        tools for this purpose, (Note: If the use of proprietary data will be
        beneficial for the final output, access to this data will need to comply
        with any proprietary requirements. The use of such data will however be
        avoided).
