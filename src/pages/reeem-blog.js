        In order to facilitate the transition to a low carbon, secure and
        competitive EU society, it is essential to:{" "}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identify the impacts of the low-carbon transition on the EU economy,
          environment and society, under different possible political, economic,
          social, technological and environmental settings;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identify winners and losers of the transition across different groups
          of actors and propose actions to reduce the divide between them;{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Explore what innovation and technological changes enable addressing
          the needs of the future energy system and incentivise decisions /
          investments in favour of the Energy Union strategy.{" "}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By using an extensive suite of world class mathematical modelling tools
        and combining them, the REEEM project aims to address these three
        questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src={methodology} alt="Methodology" />
      </p>
      <p>
        In this&nbsp;blog we summarise the first policy brief of the project
        which condenses the main insights obtained in the first 22 months of
        REEEM. In that policy brief we discuss potential impacts of high
        decarbonisation targets (in line with 80% CO2 emissions reduction from
        the energy sector by 2050 compared to 1990) in a EU political, economic,
        social, technological and environmental setting{" "}
        <b>evolving from the current one without major disruptions</b>.
        Politically, we assume the European Union holds after the financial
        crisis, with stronger energy policy parallels within clusters of
        countries (e.g. in the burden sharing of emission targets). This
        assumption recalls those of two of the five scenarios featured in the
        ‘White paper on the future of Europe’ discussed by President Jean-Claude
        Juncker at the State of the Union 2017: ‘Carrying on’ and ‘Those who
        want more do more’. Additionally, we assume that 1) the economies will
        restart growing in the near future, though at different speeds, 2) the
        society will take the energy transition as it comes, without strong
        engagement, 3) climate change will result in localised lower
        availability of water and 4) the transition will rely on currently
        commercially available technologies, without breakthrough in any others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The report sheds light on dynamics potentially occurring in different
        sectors and at different spatial scales as this transition occurs and
        draws the following recommendations:{" "}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Account for differences in the marginal cost of decarbonisation
          between Member States when proposing burden sharing in GHGs emissions
          reduction;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Study the influence of different parameters such as technology
          learning and environmental externalities, to unveil potential
          macro-economic benefits of decarbonisation;
        </li>
        <li>
          Promote the development of technologies that could effectively
          contribute to the decarbonisation of the energy industry, such as
          solar PV and onshore wind;
        </li>
        <li>
          Support innovation in storage technologies which could effectively
          influence the energy system performance;
        </li>
        <li>
          Account for different co-development dynamics in the value chain of
          energy technologies in each Member State;
        </li>
        <li>
          Develop bi-directional and iterative processes to turn the targets set
          out in the National Energy and Climate strategies into actionable
          plans at a local scale. Practically:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              During the planning phase, include in the National Energy and
              Climate strategies hard environmental constraints linked to the
              local availability of resources (e.g. limitations in the use of
              biomass);
            </li>
            <li>
              During the implementation phases, estimate the contribution of
              bottom-up energy efficiency measures at local level towards the
              achievement of national targets.

        A new report was conducted by the REEEM consortium, in early 2018,
        covering aspects of integrated modelling assessment. Sustainable
        development has been high on the global agenda over the past couple of
        decades. The challenges facing developed countries differ significantly
        from the ones developing nations encounter, though. The former need to
        transform their resource management adapting to a less carbon-intensive
        pattern, while the latter strive for meeting fundamental needs for their
        population such as access to electricity. The EU in particular appears
        to be at the leading edge of sustainable development with really
        ambitious targets been set, both mid and long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key components of sustainable development is the
        decarbonisation of the energy system. Access to energy services is the
        cornerstone of most contemporary activities and, consequently, a
        well-functioning energy system constitutes the spine of economic
        development. However, fossil fuel based energy production (which has
        been the dominant case so far) can cause severe environmental impacts.
        Moving towards an energy system with a significantly low carbon
        footprint can be a challenging task. Several factors need to be taken
        into account when different options are explored and the various
        trade-offs need to be identified. An energy system affects and is
        affected by a plethora of aspects and, therefore, its transition to a
        different pattern may have economic, social and environmental impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, when one tries to quantify and analyse the impacts of a
        long-term energy transition, a set of indicators is adopted. An
        indicator can convey a certain message either directly or through
        further analysis (e.g. GDP growth does not directly imply
        competitiveness but it may signify elements of that). The selection of
        the indicators depends on the objectives that have been set and the
        prospective audience. For example, an investment fund might be
        interested in the total potential for investments in a certain
        technology while an environmental NGO would be rather interested in the
        pollutant emissions and relative health impacts caused by the energy
        sector. In order to get a holistic picture, a certain number of
        indicators needs to be used to capture the impact of energy transition
        pathways on different dimensions (i.e. economic, social and
        environmental). Subsequently, the indicators may provide insights into
        one particular pathway or compare the performance of the energy system
        in different pathways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The REEEM project aims at analysing how different technologies can
        impact the transition to a low carbon economy in the EU28+2 (Norway and
        Switzerland) by 2050. To do so, a suite of models is used, looking at
        different aspects (macroeconomics, energy system optimisation, LCA of
        energy technologies etc.) and on different scales spanning from pan
        EU28+2 to case studies covering either single countries or even
        municipalities. In many cases those models are soft-linked resulting in
        multi-modelling framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current report aims at assessing the main impacts from the
        transition to a heavily decarbonised energy system in the EU28+2. This
        is performed by analysing the outcome of the aforementioned modelling
        framework applied on a number of pathways defined in the REEEM project.
        Although the integrated modelling framework is not yet fully developed
        and the models loosely linked, a few conclusions can be drawn from the
        developed methodologies and the first stages of the analysis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first selection of indicators highlights key impacts of the
          transition to decarbonised energy systems in each of the applications
          considered;
        </li>
        <li>
          Especially, impacts at different scales are unveiled, arguing the
          necessity of integrating models which carry out analyses at the EU,
          national and local level.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thus conceived, the messages conveyed by the indicators are meant to
        reach out to various stakeholder groups:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          General audience. European (and other) citizens of what are the main
          trends in the energy sectors and how the system could transform in the
          coming years;
        </li>
        <li>
          European Commission. The indicators assess the progress towards
          certain policy objectives related to the EU energy sector and
          decarbonisation of the economy;
        </li>
        <li>
          Energy modellers and modelling projects. A comprehensive list of
          diagnostic indicators, suitable for long-term decarbonisation
          pathways;
        </li>
        <li>
          Stakeholders. The current report gives an understanding of how the
          work in REEEM has progressed up this point;
        </li>
        <li>
          The REEEM partners and modellers. This report lays the foundations for
          the analysis of the complete REEEM modelling framework (to be reported
          in the next Integrated Impact Report due in July 2019).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, one needs to consider the fact that when different groups of
        stakeholders and audience look at these insights, they might weigh and
        even understand the indicators in different ways. Additionally, as
        mentioned, the modelling framework and the corresponding list of
        indicators are still incomplete and planned to be extended/refined by
        end of the project. The final outcomes will be published in the second
        Integrated Impact Report, due July 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full report with more information will be available online as soon
        as it is approved by the European Commission. We will announce that with
        a short news.

        Uncertainty in Science:
        <br />A case for robust energy solutions
      </h1>
      <p>

      <p>
        As researchers in the renewable energy sector, we try to find solutions
        to real-life problems. How can we decarbonize energy and transport?
        Which technologies are preferable – which ones obstruct? What does
        transitional decision-making look like? Administrations on all levels
        turn to science, hoping to receive safe parameters to base their
        decisions on. But none of the parameters we deliver today are ever truly
        certain.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good scientist accepts that no system or mechanism can ever be fully
        understood – uncertainties exist in all fields of research. Any results
        from a study or analysis, from recommendations for transition pathways
        to the number of charging points that are needed to supply electric cars
        in a specific region, are educated guesses based on historic evidence,
        simulations, and assumptions about future developments. These guesses
        can be quite accurate, when researchers know their trade, but they
        should never be viewed as universal truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is, however, a mistake that policy makers commonly seem to make
        when planning for future needs. Complex problems that entail a lot of
        uncertainties are reduced to a handful of questions and the (scientific)
        answers to these questions is often wrongfully used as justification for
        decisions that may heavily influence the fate of future generations. But
        who can blame them – the world has become incredibly complex and it
        seems now very difficult for decisions makers to find certainty in the
        solutions to the problems they are in charge of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is it now more difficult to design robust policies than a few
        decades ago? One answer lies in a general increase of
        interconnectedness. A good example for this can be found in energy
        industry itself: The different sectors, such as power, heat, and
        transport, used to be almost completely independent of each other, which
        made it easier to predict the consequences of change within the sector.
        Today, through sector coupling, a necessary step for the deep
        penetration of renewable energy, all sectors of energy are increasingly
        interlinked and influence each other, which increases the overall
        uncertainty regarding predictions on energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second reason for today’s increased uncertainty lies in impending,
        game changing technological innovations. Digitization, for instance,
        bears the potential to change many of so far well-understood problems.
        New digital mechanisms like service automation are not simply added to
        existing mechanisms, but change or terminate them. Autonomous driving is
        a good example. Full automation can alter a vehicle’s function so
        profoundly that it changes its concept entirely. While this kind of
        conceptual revolution is nothing new to us (as we have gone from horse
        wagon to combustion car), we can only know that we don’t know many of
        the consequences of such a change.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third reason for uncertainty lies in an increased awareness and
        recognition of society’s diverse values. Today’s pluralism demands that
        a large range of perspectives and values be taken into political and –
        more importantly – scientific account. Applied to modern energy systems,
        this means that the aim has shifted from the simple task of supplying
        energy cheaply and perhaps reliably to now also supplying it at the very
        least sustainably, decentralized, transparently, and socially fair. This
        is not a negative development, however, it adds immense complexity to
        the energy problem and increases the pressure on decision-makers and
        scientists in this field.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what are we to do about it? As researchers, we need to detach
        ourselves from the role of “master consultants” for society as a whole.
        Political decisions can’t be based solely on scientific foreknowledge
        and prophetic scenarios. We should rethink the way we do energy research
        and pay more attention to the uncertainties which inevitably frame our
        results, whether we want it or not. In light of uncertainty, the more
        popular term for robustness, resilience, is not a blank buzz word, but
        has actually replaced optimality as the guiding principle of designing
        energy solutions.
        <br />
        Energy transition is tedious, so we must think of better ways to
        communicate our research results and their reliability for future
        purposes. Political decisions must be informed by robust expert advice
        and supported through public dialogue – with science and everyone else.
        We cannot easily overcome the increasing complexity of things, but if we
        stop ignoring the obvious uncertainties, we take a step into the right
        direction. If we find out what we don’t know, we will gain even better
        understanding of the energy transition problem, increase public trust in
        our work, and finally stop the kind of path-dependent decision-making
        that previous generations of scientists have already burdened us with.
        <br />
        Uncertainty classification, multi-objective optimization and exploratory
        modeling are just a few of many powerful approaches in this direction.
