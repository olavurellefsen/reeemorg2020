        The key characteristics of the storylines underpinning each pathway and
        the relative main assumptions are summarised in the table below.

      <h3>Coalitions for a low-carbon path</h3>
      <p>
        Economic growth in the EU restarts after the financial crisis, but at
        different speeds across Member States. Affinity on trade, labour,
        defence and energy security policy arises between groups of countries,
        depending on their geographic location, economy and domestic
        availability of resources. Under a general political recognition of the
        impacts of climate change, the EU sets itself on a high decarbonisation
        path. The emission targets for sectors included in the Emission Trading
        Scheme (ETS) are complied with and overshot in some instances, leading
        to 83% cut in energy-related CO2 emissions by 2050 compared to 1990. On
        the contrary, sectors not regulated by the ETS rely more on consumers’
        choices and reduce emissions to a lesser extent. Additionally, despite
        the common general ambition to fulfil the Energy Union Strategy and the
        Paris Agreement, coalitions of more and less willing Member States
        emerge, setting more and less ambitious decarbonisation targets for
        non-ETS sectors.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar coalitional pattern emerges outside Europe, where countries
        being most affected by climate change extremes and/or having the means
        take on more climate change mitigation actions than others.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Energy carrier suppliers and large industrial users subject to ETS
        targets take up large part of the decarbonisation effort. On the
        contrary, even though the effects of climate change are observed in
        Europe (especially with Southern regions becoming on average warmer and
        drier), not all consumers across the EU perceive it as likely to affect
        their lives significantly. Therefore, they tend to hold on to their
        current consumption behaviours and transition more slowly to energy
        efficient end-use appliances, unless pushed otherwise by top-down
        policies. This ultimately causes the levels of ambition for sectors not
        included in the ETS (such as residential and transportation) to be
        generally lower and to vary between Member States.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the pressure of policy targets, utilities undertake large
        investments in centralised renewable energy supply options. In the
        electricity sector, solar photovoltaic fields and wind farms (both
        onshore and offshore) dominate. Innovation in offshore wind by
        breakthrough of floating platforms contributes to the penetration of the
        technology in the market. Biomass-fired power plants and, to a minor
        extent, Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS), gain a small share.
        Decarbonisation measures in end use sectors remain more limited. The
        rate of renovation of residential buildings increases considerably
        compared to the current rate, but not enough to guarantee complete
        renovation of the stock by 2050. Technologies such as heat pumps and
        solar thermal are not cost competitive enough to gain a share in the
        energy mix.
      </p>
      <p>
        This pathway was agreed upon as a useful base case for REEEM by the
        participants of the First Stakeholder Workshop held on October 6th 2017
        in Brussels. It resembles characteristics of two of the five scenarios
        described in the ‘
        <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/white_paper_on_the_future_of_europe_en.pdf">
          White paper on the future of Europe
        </a>
        ’ discussed by President Jean-Claude Juncker at the State of the Union
        2017: ‘Carrying on’ and ‘Those who want more do more’.
      </p>
      <h3>Local solutions</h3>
      <p>
        The transition to a low carbon EU energy system is accelerated by
        communities and households proactively making choices that are low
        carbon, such as on household energy provision (i.e., stronger efforts to
        retrofit homes, purchasing of energy efficient (and smart) appliances,
        replacement of heating systems).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        This moderately stronger societal push is underpinned by a{" "}
        <i>recognition</i> of the increasing and stronger climate signals, both
        within and outside of Europe (i.e. more pronounced and frequent flooding
        events in Europe, particularly in the winter, and longer and more
        extreme hot spells during the summer months, leading to wild fires,
        water shortages and heat-related health impacts).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The pace of change in the demand for low carbon goods initially leaves
        decision makers in the EU lagging behind in their policy efforts to
        drive the transition. This lag is particularly evident out to 2030 due
        to the initial rapid rate of change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Member States are set on course to 80% reduction in
        energy-related GHG emissions by 2050 as compared to 1990. However,
        coalitions of more and less willing countries set different targets for
        sectors not covered by the Emission Trading Scheme, depending on their
        geographic location, economy and domestic availability of resources. A
        coalitional pattern similar to the one within the EU is identifiable
        outside Europe. These aspects are similar to the Coalitions for a low
        carbon path.
      </p>
      <p>
        This pathway was suggested by participants at a scenario workshop in
        Brussels on October 6th 2017 as an interesting scenario narrative to
        explore in the context of the REEEM project.
      </p>
      <h3>Paris Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C, the effects of
        climate change obtain increasing media coverage. Climate strikes start
        worldwide and put pressure on Governments and public opinion. Awareness
        of the effects of climate change increases globally, both on the side of
        Governments and on the one of citizens.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        In the EU, green parties increase their representation in the
        Parliament. At the same time, the EU emerges stronger from the Brexit
        negotiations and the financial crisis. This leads to growing alignment
        between Member States on environment and climate matters, as envisaged
        by President Juncker in two scenarios of the ‘White Paper on the future
        of Europe’. The EU makes a political commitment to taking the world lead
        in fulfilling the Paris Agreement and sets a target of at least 95%
        reduction of GHGs emissions by 2050 compared to 1990 levels.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side, the increased awareness by citizens results in
        behavioural shifts and green choices. These come especially when
        replacing household heating appliances and cars which reached end of
        life or when offered the chance to renovate old, inefficient buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stringent policies provide the incentives and the policy certainty for
        large consumers and energy carrier suppliers to also shift towards low
        carbon options. Industrial consumers replace fossil fuels in their
        primary energy supply for heating with biomass and electricity. As
        Carbon Capture and Sequestration technologies become commercial, they
        are applied to industrial biomass plants, making industry a net negative
        emissions sector. Energy carrier suppliers also invest significantly in
        renewable options, particularly for large-scale centralised electricity
        generation. Overall, increased electrification of the energy supply is
        observed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decarbonisation effort undertaken in the EU demonstrates the
        feasibility of a low-carbon economy and opens market opportunities for
        other economies, where parts of the value chains of low-carbon
        technologies are located. In these economies, investments in the
        production of low-carbon technologies increase quickly and policies are
        put in place to support these investments. The United States and China
        take advantage from large economies of scale and solid market shares in
        the production of low-carbon technologies. This soon gives them a
        competitive edge and the two economies are set on a path towards
        decreasing GHGs emissions to Paris Agreement levels. Other world
        economies follow the same path.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, the shift from the technologically mature and
        short-term secure fossil fuel supply and the large infrastructure
        investments put a burden on European economies. GDP growth across Member
        States is slowed, hindering the competitiveness of the EU versus China
        and the United States. However, the rate of growth increases closer to
        2050. Furthermore, the projected economic benefits from avoided
        externalities are important.
      </p>
      <p>
        This pathway was first discussed at the REEEM GA in Zagreb 14-15 May
        2018 as an important future to explore in the context of the REEEM
        project.
