      The Energy Modelling Platform for Europe (EMP-E) was first created within
      the REEEM project. Its first event was held in Brussels on May 17th-18th,
      2017;
    </p>
    <p>
      The second meeting of the{" "}
      <a href="https://www.energymodellingplatform.eu/">EMP-E</a> was on
      September 25th-26th 2018 in Brussels, at the premises of the European
      Commission’s DG R&I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key themes discussed at the 2018 meeting were Innovation in the energy
      transition, Integrated modelling of energy and resource efficiency and
      Modelling of behavioural aspects. The first day was dedicated to plenary
      sessions, while the second day was dedicated to parallel focus group
      sessions. On both days the participants were provided space and time for
      poster presentations on their modelling activities, research and insights.
      Linked to the event, a call for papers for a Special Issue of Energy
      Strategy Reviews (Elsevier) was issued, with deadline for full paper
      submission on September 12th 2018.

      of the 2018 event, too.

    <p>
      REEEM organised the plenary session on ‘Integrated modelling of energy and
      resource efficiency’, held on September 25th 2018 and moderated by Dr.
      Kenneth Karlsson (DTU).
    </p>
    <p>
      REEEM partners also organised the following parallel sessions, held on
      September 26th:
    </p>
    <h4>1A - open databases</h4>
    <p>
      In this focus group we bring together participants from various projects
      who aim for or even manage to openly provide their data. We will discuss
      how we can improve the exchange or linking of data that we use in energy
      system analyses and what is needed to facilitate that willing projects can
      easier open up their data.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this focus group we aim at defining tasks to reach a higher share of
      open data and a better cooperation between the EU-projects concerning data
      that all of them normally use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The session will start with short inputs about data handling in the
      projects present at the focus group (how do you organize/structure your
      data and how do you provide it to partners and eventually other
      stakeholders? in your opinion, what is the most important ToDo to improve
      exchange of data between EU-projects?). For the following discussion we
      will devide into handable working groups and tackle the topics:
    </p>
    How openly provide and bring together our data (common DBs or links,
    datapackages or…?) Which steps to take to really do it? Do we need to
    harmonize meta data and the categorisation of data? If yes, how can we
    achieve that? Which data is often needed for analyses and not available
    (e.g. costs, distribution lines, industry energy demand, behaviour,…) in
    which ways do you help yourself to replace it/ to generate the data
    synthetically… How can we share the scarce information available?
    <p>
      If you are interested to participate in this group and to explain how your
      project handles the modelling data we are happy to receive a short note as
      soon as possible to better prepare the discussions.

    <h4>1B - energy, climate and macroeconomic relationships</h4>​
    <p>
      The struggle of the EU to move towards a carbon free society results in an
      increasing concern about human induced climate change. Consequently, the
      environmental, economic and energetic impacts of policies are considered
      of equal importance. Therefore, this session aims on identifying different
      modelling frameworks that address each of these aspects (economy, energy
      and environment) and on discussing how they can be jointly applied in
      order to deliver an integrated assessment of policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The session consists of two parts. The first part will mainly show the
      current state of research in this area. Three experts will outline the
      objectives of integrated analyses and present their respective coupling
      approaches. Furthermore, they will specify which aspects of the three
      dimensions they have taken into account in their models. Based on their
      current research experience they will give insights on occurring
      interactions and, subsequently, point out the requirements needed for
      further development of model linking approaches. In addition, the
      consideration of innovation, behaviour and environmental externalities
      will be addressed within this section. Hence, each speaker will give a
      short overview on how these aspects can be implemented. In the second part
      all three presenters will be invited to participate in a moderated panel
      discussion.

    <h4>2B - modelling of behavioural aspects</h4>
    <p>
      Format: The session will begin with scene-setting input from the European
      Commission followed by presentations from the panelists. Following these,
      and after a brief Q&A with the audience, we will begin a discussion with
      the panelists and the audience to address the questions outlined in the
      objectives above. Participants will also be provided with a scorecard to
      document their responses to the workshop questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objective: In recent years there has been increasing interest and need to
      understand and incorporate behavioral aspects into energy modelling. The
      interdisciplinary nature of energy behavior means a common language and
      platform for exchange on the topic is required. While there are numerous
      models available, each incorporates different aspects and sectors of
      behavior with varying methodologies. Given the sometimes contrasting focus
      from specific disciplines, it would be useful to explore how behavioral
      aspects are included with the aim of providing energy system-wide policy
      recommendations. The plenary session on “Modelling of behavioral aspects”
      looked at the different modelling approaches to explore how behavior is
      included into different energy models and why these approaches would be
      appropriate depending on the policy questions at hand. In this focus
      group, we will explore deeper not only the models and their methodologies,
      but also the specific behavioural aspects to be included in energy
      modelling. With this in mind, the focus will be to discuss the following
      questions:
    </p>
    In which sectors and how is behavior included (buildings, transport,
    conversion, cross-cutting?) What are the main barriers in the building and
    transport sectors related to behavioral aspects? How are the perspectives on
    behavior from different disciplines integrated into energy modelling?

    <h4>3B - regional vs national vs Europe-wide modelling</h4>
    <p>
      What do policy makers need when it comes to making national energy and
      climate policy decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      High level energy and climate target are negotiated at EU level and
      implemented at national level by national governments. As part of new EU
      governance rules, Member States must develop short and long term
      Integrated National Energy and Climate Plans. These plans will be informed
      by modelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understand the policy making process is integral to achieving impact with
      modelling results. This focus group looks at our community from a policy
      maker perspective and discusses the requirements (both technical and
      non-technical) of policy makers when using model results and asks how
      academic research can create relevant policy impact. Two policy makers
      from national government to give their perspectives and answer questions
      from listeners.
