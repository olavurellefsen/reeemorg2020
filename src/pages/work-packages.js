    <p>
      The REEEM project is divided into 7 core work packages (WPs 1-7) and 1
      supporting work package on “Project Management” (WP8), which are briefly
      described below.
    </p>
    <h4>WP1 “Transformation Strategies and Pathways” - leader KTH</h4>
    <p>
      WP1 defines the various pathways assessed as part of this proposal. It
      identifies overarching socio-economic drivers and supportive policy
      measures, and translates them into key assumptions for the pathway
      clusters for further refinement in the other work packages. This work
      package further combines, interprets and summarizes the results from the
      pathways analysis of the other work packages and provides recommendations
      on energy strategies.
    </p>

    <p>Objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Help to ensure that pathways are of political relevance to the EU energy
        policy dialogue
      </li>
      <li>
        Define the pathways consistently across the various work packages and
        modelling tools
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop environmental, economic and social indicators for assessing the
        impacts across the pathways
      </li>
      <li>
        Synthesize assessment results from WPs 2 – 6 in a single process,
        ensuring that a distinct, holistic assessment of energy technology
        implications is provided for each pathway, balanced across society,
        environment and economy. This will include energy strategy
        recommendations
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>WP2 “Technology and Innovation” - leader KIC IE</h4>
    <p>
      WP2 will identify key parameters and indicators to measure technology
      development. Using the SET-Plan as a basis, WP2 will consolidate a
      comprehensive inventory of energy technologies and explore their role in
      the transformation pathways of the overall energy system. Primary outputs
      of this WP will be Technology Roadmaps that are supplemented with
      Innovation Readiness Level assessments – which represent the “market pull”
      aspect of energy technology deployment.
    </p>

    <p>Objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Develop Technology Roadmaps and Market Potentials for key technologies
      </li>
      <li>Map out the Innovation Readiness Level of energy technologies</li>
      <li>
        Develop a methodology for linking technology innovation to
        energy-economic models
      </li>
      <li>Improve the technology representation in energy system models</li>
      <li>
        Measure the impacts of technology innovation through economic, societal
        and environmental indicators
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>WP3 “Economy” - leader USTUTT</h4>
    <p>
      WP3 will model and analyse the economic impacts of energy development and
      innovation in the energy system and corresponding technology policy
      measures in the framework of the SET-Plan. This helps to understand
      interactions between the energy system and the EU economy such as
      distributional impacts and “winners and losers” of specific energy
      pathways.
    </p>

    <p>Objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Analyse interactions and interdependencies with the energy system and
        the economy
      </li>
      <li>Provide macroeconomic energy demand feedbacks</li>
      <li>
        Analyse allocative impacts of different policies and technological
        developments in the EU economy
      </li>
      <li>
        Assess distributional impacts and identify “winners and losers” (e.g.,
        gains and losses of sectoral competitiveness, net job creation or
        budgetary implications for households)
      </li>
      <li>Derive and present strategy recommendations</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>WP4 “Society, Consumers and Behaviour” - leader UCL</h4>
    <p>
      WP4 plays a dual-role: First, it will better integrate behaviour and
      consumer heterogeneity into the modelling of the energy system-wide low
      carbon transition. Second, it will assess the impacts of the SET-Plan on
      individuals across the EU and across different demographic groups. It will
      also analyse the larger impacts on the society and on policy requirements.
    </p>

    <p>Objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve the understanding and modelling of consumer choice</li>
      <li>
        Assess how consumer preferences may differ across countries and how
        these differences might affect energy system transitions
      </li>
      <li>
        Assess and downscale the distribution impacts of specific SET pathways
      </li>
      <li>
        Evaluate the energy poverty related policies in the context of the
        SET-Plan and provide recommendations
      </li>
      <li>Derive and present strategy recommendations</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>WP5 “Environment, Health and Resources” - leader DTU</h4>
    <p>
      WP5 will look at environmental impacts of the European energy system and
      related external costs. It will create a broad set of environmental,
      health and resource indicators and study how following the EU SET-Plan can
      influence these indicators. It will also assess how resilient different
      SET transitions may be to the impacts caused by the changing climate.
    </p>

    <p>Objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Assess health impacts from air pollution associated with different
        pathways
      </li>
      <li>Perform Life Cycle Assessments for alternative energy systems</li>
      <li>
        Investigate the role of critical materials in different transition
        pathways
      </li>
      <li>

        and ecosystem services
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>WP6 “Energy Systems Integration” - leader USTUTT</h4>
    <p>
      WP6 will develop an Integrated European Energy System Model which
      holistically represents energy resources, supply and demand technologies
      and related infrastructure. It will enable the analysis of demands, as
      well as environmental, social and economic impacts. A special focus is the
      impact of technological development and innovation on the energy system
      and the modelling of related EU policy measures. This work package will
      act as the modelling centrepiece by coordinating the data exchange with
      the satellite models in work packages 3, 4 and 5.
    </p>

    <p>Objectives:</p>
