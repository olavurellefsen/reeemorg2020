      <p>
        We, the cluster LCE-21-2015, consisting of four Horizon 2020 projects
        working on “Modelling and analysing the energy system, its
        transformation and impacts”, are pleased to announce the{" "}
        <strong>
          Second Meeting of an Energy Modelling Platform for Europe (EMP-E) 2018
        </strong>
        , hosted on <strong>September 25th and 26th</strong> by the European
        Commission DG Research &amp; Innovation in Brussels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EMP-E culminates in a yearly conference, bringing together
        scientists and policy makers to discuss cutting edge energy modelling
        issues. Stakeholders are provided with a peer-reviewed digest of model
        and policy insights for European energy scenario. The platform serves as
        a continuous forum for exchanging research, development and practice of
        energy system modelling in Europe and, where feasible, promote the
        sharing of data and resources. It thus shall increase the efficiency,
        integrity and access to European energy modelling data, scenarios, tools
        and results.
      </p>
      <h3>Programme</h3>
      <p>
        The agenda of this year’s meeting of the Energy Modelling Platform
        includes <strong>three plenary sessions</strong> with key themes to be
        highlighted being ‘modelling of behavioural aspects’, ‘integrated
        modelling of energy and resource efficiency’ as well as ‘innovation in
        the energy transition’. Thanks to the active involvement of EC
        representatives and leading researchers, we can ensure to bridge the gap
        between modelling and policy making at European, regional and local
        level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond that, you will have the possibility to participate in up to three
        out of <strong>nine&nbsp;focus groups</strong>, which&nbsp;deal with
        specialised topics, such as ‘open databases and open modelling’. Most
        focus group are set up and headed by researchers from either SET-NAV,
        MEDEAS, REFLEX or REEEM projects but there is room left for proactive
        contribution from your side.
      </p>
      <p>
        We particularly emphasize the planned <strong>networking space</strong>,
        which is structured as an open space where all participants, from
        decision makers to invited researchers and modelling teams, can meet and
        exchange on common questions and the exhibited posters. The networking
        space constitutes a central part of the conference, from which you
        should get an overview about the EU Model-landscape and an insight to
        ongoing projects.
      </p>
      <h3>Publication</h3>
      <p>
        The results of the meeting will be published after a peer-review process
        in a special issue of the journal{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>Energy Strategy Reviews </em>
        </strong>
        (Elsevier), which will be provided as input to high-level events such as
        COP24 in Katowice.
      </p>
      <h3>Registration</h3>
      <p>
        Further details regarding participation, registration and the full
        program will follow shortly. All information and updates of the event
        are published on the homepage:

      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that back to back to EMP-E 2018 there is another event we
        recommend to you: the Horizon 2020 project EUFORIE invites you to a
        policy-oriented Roundtable discussion on energy efficiency on 27
        September 2018 – for further information please visit&nbsp;{" "}

      </p>
      <p>
        We are looking forward to discuss modelling issues with you at the side
        of your posters, in the focus groups and in the plenary.
