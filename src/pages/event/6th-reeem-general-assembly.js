    <p>
      From November 26th to 28th, the sixth semi-annual General Assembly will be
      held. This time, the REEEM project partner TOKNI in Torshavn, Faroe
      Islands, will host the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three days, partners of the REEEM project will come together to present
      the work from their work packages, exchange ideas and discuss the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The focus of the REEEM General Assembly’s Agenda will be collecting
      insights for the integrated impact assessment of EU transition pathways.
      The three key pathways analyzed in the REEEM project are explained on the
      REEEM website. Also the IPCC’s report 2018 which was published in October,
      will be discussed and debated, how the pathways recommended by the IPCC
      report and the pathways developed in the REEEM project can get along.
